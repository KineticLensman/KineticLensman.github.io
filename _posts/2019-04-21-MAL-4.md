title: "Make a Lisp [4] Technical SITREP"

This is the fourth SITREP for my ongoing Make-a-Lisp project - a multi-step process that involves implementing `JKL`: a Lisp interpreter capable, in theory, of self-hosting. Prior posts include [Background](https://www.non-kinetic-effects.co.uk/blog/2019/01/01/MAL-1), 
[Steps 0-4](https://www.non-kinetic-effects.co.uk/blog/2019/01/21/MAL-2) and [Steps 5-8](https://www.non-kinetic-effects.co.uk/blog/2019/04/14/MAL-3).

## Summary

Step 9 is the penultimate step, and adds exception handling and two new core functions: `map` and `apply`. It's good to be back on track after the painfully slow progress of Step 8.

The source code is on [Github](https://github.com/KineticLensman/JK-s-Lisp/tree/master/Mal-step-9).

## Step 9

The `JKL` REPL handles errors (such as a call to an undefined function) that occur during reading or evaluation using a C# `try...throw...catch...` mechanism. Without such a mechanism, errors would potentially crash `JKL`. Step 9 makes a similar mechanism available to hosted Lisp code, so that user-defined functions can themselves raise errors without stopping the overall program and dropping back to the underlying `JKL` REPL. Error handling was very quick to implement (two evenings), given that the `JKL` mechanisms are really just wrappers around the underlying C# equivalents. Pleasingly, the approach I used integrated cleanly with the TCO loop inside `EVAL` (from step 5).

`apply` and `map` were also both very quick (an hour or so for coding and running tests) with no significant problems to overcome. I initially used `EVAL` internally to each to apply the function, but then realised that the `Apply` method associated with `JKL` functions is there for precisely this reason, so redid them both properly.

At this point, I'm almost ready for the last step, which is different from all the prior steps - as will be described in the next post in this series.
