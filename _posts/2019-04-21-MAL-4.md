title: "Make a Lisp [4] Technical SITREP"

This is the fourth SITREP for my ongoing Make-a-Lisp project - a multi-step process that involves implementing JKL: a Lisp interpreter capable, in theory, of self-hosting. Prior posts include [Background](https://www.non-kinetic-effects.co.uk/blog/2019/01/01/MAL-1), 
[Steps 0-4](https://www.non-kinetic-effects.co.uk/blog/2019/01/21/MAL-2) and [Steps 5-8](https://www.non-kinetic-effects.co.uk/blog/2019/04/14/MAL-3).



## Summary

Step 9 is the penultimate step, and adds exception handling and two new core functions: `map` and `apply`. It's good to be back on track after the painfully slow progress of Step 8.

The source code is on [Github](https://github.com/KineticLensman/JK-s-Lisp/tree/master/Mal-step-9).

## Step 9

JKL exception handling uses a standard `try...throw...catch...` approach, and was in fact very quick to implement (two evenings), given that my implementation language (C#) itself uses the same basic mechanism. In effect, the JKL `try...throw...catch...` are wrappers around their underlying C# equivalents. The JKL REPL look already includes a `try...catch...` mechanism for the many possible errors that can be raised when the reader or `EVAL` detect errors. Pleasingly, the approach I used integrated cleanly with the TCO loop inside `EVAL`.

`apply` and `map` were also both very quick (an hour or so for coding and running tests) with no significant problems to overcome. I initially used `EVAL` internally to each to apply the function, but then realised that the `Apply` method associated with JKL functions is there for precisely this reason, so redid them both properly.

At this point, I'm almost ready for the last step, which is different from all the prior steps - as will be described in the next post in this series. Before I get to it, part of me feels that I should run a full set of regression tests on all of the prior steps, to make sure that I have a wholly stable base from which to proceed. But that is going to be tedious, so I'll probably crack on anyway.
