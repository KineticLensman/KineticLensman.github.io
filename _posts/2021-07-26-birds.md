# General

## Handling guidance
Don’t try to stroke their feathers. The birds are fairly good natured but this might get you a peck.

(demo position) Stand side-on with your left arm / glove side to where the bird is coming from. Make a firm fist with your thumb on top, hand not higher than your shoulder.

This position makes it more obvious to the birds where they are supposed to land. Also means that a bird can easily fly past you if there is a gust of wind or it suddenly decides not to land.

Keep your right hand well out of the way - don't be tempted to stroke or poke the birds.

We are going to handle the food for you and give signals to attract the bird.

You can take pictures although not when the bird is trying to land on you.

## Personal advice

Don’t kneel down to the birds (although Graham did with the vultures)

Feed Walter with a ‘sweep’ to his beak.

Vultures look for the food and not the signal? Not sure about this – it seems to work from the balcony and the mound.

# General	things to talk about

## Raptors and birds of prey

Raptors – which means ‘seize by force’ – kill with their feet rather than their beaks.

## General

Bigger birds live longer

Birds in captivity can live two or three times longer than in the wild.

Wild Tawny Owls might live for five years. Troy is (?) 11. Troy was ill with a heart condition for a while.

## Recognition

Males and females usually have similar plumage (if not identical). Size is usually the biggest discriminator – with females larger.

Falcons have longer ‘scythe’-shaped wings compared with Eagles and Hawks.

Red kites have forked tails, buzzard tail is squarer / diamond shaped.

## Flight
Talk about how birds land - flaring to lose speed. Parachutists do the same. Planes can’t rotate their wings but they extend flaps which has a similar effect.

## Detecting prey

Hawks and falcons use sight – their hearing isn’t much better than ours. Owls have good sight AND excellent hearing.

Bird eyes are closer to reptile eyes than mammals like ours – birds descended from dinosaur-like creature. Some birds (notably owls) have elongated eyes so can’t move them in their eye sockets – hence head movements (some owls can go 270 degrees in each direction)

Raptors don’t usually have a good sense of smell. The main exception are New World vultures, which have a good sense of smell – as evidenced by their large nostrils (nares) that you can actually see through.

# Owls
## General

There are five species of owl in the UK: Tawny, Barn, Long eared, short-eared, and Little Owl (although this was actually introduced in the 1800s).

## Barn Owl

UK Barn owls are the only example of this genus.
## Tawny owls
Most common (?) UK owl

We can have lots of these in the hospital

What to do if you find one

Cite Troy as an example of how not to do it (he was kept for three weeks as a chick and fed by hand every day)

## Great grey

Large owl on the outside but little on the inside

Very low flier

In the same genus – Strix – as Tawny Owls – woodland hunters.

## Eagle owl
Cinnamon and Molly

One of the largest owls and can take quite large prey
Don’t have large ranges and don’t travel very much
Very long-lived – twenty years even in the wild
Doing relatively well because of their large range and diverse diet – they will catch and eat almost anything

## Milky eagle owl
XXXXX

# Vultures

## White headed vultures
Will sometimes catch live prey (e.g. mongooses and squirrels) – almost unique amongst vultures.

# Raptors - General

## Eagles
Bald eagles are a type of fishing eagle and as such have the characteristic white patterns that confuse fish.

Tawny and steppe eagles are ‘booted’ – they have feathers down their legs unlike most raptors.
