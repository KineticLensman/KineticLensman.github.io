# A New Year's resolution for 2019: Make a Lisp

Lisp first appeared in 1958, one of four programming languages (the others being FORTRAN, COBOL and Algol) that enabled the nascent software engineering industry. I recently decided to reinvigorate my knowledge of computer science by attempting to create my very own modern version of Lisp. To do this, I have to understand the computing concepts that underlie a language like Lisp, and be able to implement them in a suitable software development environment.

I'm making the completion of this project a resolution for 2019.

# Making a Lisp

I'm not starting this project from a completely clean state. Specifically, I'm following a step-by-step process taken from the [Make a Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) website developed by Joel Martin. If you follow the nine steps, you end up with software (an interpreter) that can interactively read and process statements in `Mal`, Joel's Lisp-like language.

You might think that simply following someone else's instructions is cheating. However, the instructions assume a working knowledge of programming, and don't include sample code that you can simply copy and paste. For example, here is the first instruction of the first step:

*"Add the 4 trivial functions READ, EVAL, PRINT, and rep (read-eval-print). READ, EVAL, and PRINT are basically just stubs that return their first parameter (a string if your target language is a statically typed) and rep calls them in order passing the return to the input of the next."*

Successive instructions describe more complex tasks, ending up with the somewhat mind-bending concept of making the `Mal` interpreter sufficiently powerful that it can self-host, that is, run a copy of itself.

For the implementation language and editing environment, I've chosen [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/?view=vs-2017), largely because they are similar to the tools I used back when I was actually paid to write software, and I have [recent experience](https://www.non-kinetic-effects.co.uk/blog/2018/12/24/generative) with them. I know that creating `Mal` in C# is doable, because Joel's github includes the [full source code](https://github.com/kanaka/mal/tree/master/cs) of a C# `Mal` interpreter, along with `Mal`s written in approximately 70 other programming languages. However, I'm going to try to avoid looking at this reference implementation, figuring out what the instructions mean on my own, without building on the work of the open source enthusiasts that have gone down this path before me. If something completely defeats me, I'll allow myself to look at one of the non-C# implementations for guidance.

In future posts in this series, I'll describe my progress as I work toward completing this task. Just to finish off though, I'll admit that another reason for calling this task a *resolution* (rather than just another side project) is that I've previously tried and failed to complete it. A couple of years ago, I tried to Make a Lisp using the [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) programming language. The unfamiliarity of Clojure and its tooling (the [GNU EMACS](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) editor and the [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) build tools) added too much complexity, and I gave up during the second step.
