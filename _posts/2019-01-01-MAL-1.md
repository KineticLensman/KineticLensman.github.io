# A New Year's resolution for 2019: Make a Lisp

I've decided to reinvigorate my programming skills by creating a version of the programming language Lisp. This project is a New Year's resolution for 2019.

# Lisp

The Lisp programming language first appeared in 1958, one of four early languages (the others being FORTRAN, COBOL and Algol) that massively influenced the subsequent development of computing technology. By way of example, here is a short Lisp expression that can generate [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)...

```
(def! fibonacci  (fn* (N)
   (if (= N 0)
      1
      (if (= N 1)
         1
         (+ (fibonacci (- N 1)) (fibonacci (- N 2)))))))
```

A Lisp interpreter is software that can read a Lisp expression, evaluate it to produce an answer, print the answer out, and then loop back to the beginning to read the next expression. This cycle is typically referred to as a Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL. If I loaded the fibonacci code into a Lisp interpreter, I'd be able to run it by typing something like `(fibonacci 42)`, to which the interpreter would respond `267914296`. From the perspective of 2019, it's now hard to appreciate the power of the REPL concept - but in 1958 it was one of the first real steps toward the interactive computing environments that we now take for granted.

# Making a Lisp

The goal of this project is write a Lisp interpreter (software than can run a REPL). I'm following instructions, taken from the [Make a Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) website, for creating an interpreter for a fully featured subset of Lisp - `Mal`. The instructions assume a working knowledge of programming and take the form of narrative statements, not code that you can copy and paste. The instructions define a step-by-step process, in which each step gradually adds more functionality to the emerging `Mal` interpreter. The initial steps create quite simple interpreters (e.g. one that can do basic arithmetic) but the later steps add real computing power, culminating in an interpreter powerful to itself host a Lisp interpreter.

The Make-a-Lisp instructions don't assume that you will use any specific programming language to build the interpreter. I've therefore chosen [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/?view=vs-2017), largely because they are similar to the tools I used when I wrote software professionally. I know that implementing a `Mal` interpreter in C# is doable, because the Make-a-Lisp website includes the [full source code](https://github.com/kanaka/mal/tree/master/cs) for a `Mal` interpreter written in C#, along with versions of `Mal` written in more than 70 different programming languages. To avoid cheating, I'm going to try to avoid looking at the C# reference implementation unless something really defeats me.

Future posts in this series will describe my progress as I work toward completing this task. I'll call my Mal interpreter `JKL`.
