## Introduction

This is the first of a two part blog on practical barbeque techniques concentrating on the equipment and how you use it. The second will look at cooking techniques for different types of food.
## Equipment

First, the essential equipment

* The barbeque itself. I use a Weber kettle grill. This is a large metal kettle with a lower charcoal grate and a cooking grate that sits a few inches over the charcoal grate. Crucially, as we will see, it also has a lid.
* Charcoal in the form of briquettes (coal). Briquettes are more expensive than lumpwood charcoal, but the individual coals are more even in size and manageable than random bits of wood, and they will pump out heat for much, much longer. They allow long duration cooking of a couple of hours.
* Two pairs of tongs: one for moving raw / partially cooked food, one that is only used for food that is cooked or in the final stages of cooking. I'm really strict about not mixing up the raw and cooked tongs, and in fact mine have different coloured handles so that I don't get them confused.
* Firelighter cubes. These are marketed with varying degrees of eco-friendliness, but I personally go for the ones that light most reliably (the white petroleum-based variety). I don't use gels or lighter fluid.
* A lighter - either long safety matches or a butane gas lighter.
* Some sort of hand protection (oven gloves, leather garden gloves, etc) for handling really hot metal.

Optional stuff
* A pair of tongs for moving coals around when lighting the barbeque. You could use the raw food tongs for this as well, if you don't mind tiny specks of coal possibly getting on the food.
* A chimney starter - a fat metal cylinder with holes punched in the side and a shielded carry handle. I use an old discarded kitchen frying pan as a base for the chimney to stop hot ash falling through onto the ground or my feet.
* Metal skewers. Any skewers will do, but I prefer the sort that have a fat handle at one for ease of turning and double pronged skewers for delicate items (e.g. mushrooms).
* Grilling pan. This looks like a frying pan but has lots of holes punched in it. It's good for burgers or similar that you want to slide around and flip but that might fall through the holes of a regular cooking grate.
* Other cooking tools including spatulas, forks etc.
* Flavoured smoking wood (such as mesquite) to enhance the uniquely smoky taste of certain foods.
* A large dustpan and brush for collecting the ash residue when the barbeque has completely cooled down.

## Lighting the barbeque

First, I position the barbeque in an open-air area and make sure all of the air vents are fully open. If necessary I temporarily close nearby windows to stop the ignition smoke going inside. I avoid using the barbeque inside or near the entrance to an enclosed area (such as a tent) because of the whole 'carbon monoxide makes everybody die' thing.

To light the barbeque, I put a single flat layer of coals onto the charcoal grate, shaped into a rough circle. I then place four of five firelighter cubes near the centre, and light them using the lighter. Once they are lit, and working quickly, I make a crude pyramid of coals over the cubes, using tongs to reposition the ones that fall off. I then leave it for 15 minutes or so and go to do some meat preparation or similar. When I get back, the outer coals will still be mainly unburnt, but there should be a good red glow in the middle. At this point, I poke the pyramid a bit and rebuild it, using tongs, to gradually move the unburnt coals closer to the centre. I'll repeat the process a couple of times over the next 10 to 20 minutes. It's ready to cook when most of the coals are covered in white ash, and there are no real flames visible. The barbeque will generate quite a lot of smoke in the first few minutes just after ignition but this should all have cleared well before you start cooking.

The alternative approach to lighting is to use a starter chimney. The basic technique is similar: put some coal and lighter cubes on the base, light it, and then pour in more coals on top. The advantage of chimneys is that you don't need to move the coals around to get them evenly burnt, and the concentrated heat means that they are ready faster. You are however limited by the size of the chimney: a small one can't make sufficient coals for a large barbeque in a single batch.  

Because I enjoy the process, I prefer the 'pyramid' approach, unless I'm in a real hurry, or it's raining. 

## Cooking

How I position the coals reflects the two different ways of cooking using a barbeque:
* Direct - the coals are spread across the charcoal grate and the food is placed directly over them - this is 'classic' barbeque mode.
* Indirect - the coals are scooped to the sides of the charcoal grate, leaving an empty strip in the middle, over which the food goes. Indirect cooking is great for large food items that need a long cooking time so that they get cooked through without their surfaces being carbonised.

In practice I often go for a sort-of half way house between direct and indirect, with one edge of the charcoal grate left coal-free so that I get a heat gradient of very hot, hot and quite hot. I use the very hot / hot side for direct cooking, and can put things that I want done more slowly over the less hot side. I can then do a multi-course meal, with the first course cooked more directly, and later courses indirectly cooked, gradually getting moved toward the hotter side as the meal progresses. This is a great way to deal with things like chicken that needs a long cook (perhaps 30 mins) to get properly done throughout. It also gives me a chance to eat as well, while waiting for the indirectly cooked stuff. 

However, the secret to both direct and indirect cooking is to use the kettle lid. Put the food in position (making sure nothing will get scorched by intense direct heat), put the lid on and then leave things for at least five minutes before lifting the lid to check progress and perhaps turn things or move them closer to or further away from to the heat. Occasionalt turns like this also help to ensure that food is evenly cooked on all sides. When cooking solely using indirect heat, I might not lift the lid for really long times, perhaps 30 mins to an hour depending on what I'm cooking.

Using the lid really helps:
* It lets heat build up inside the kettle, making the overall temperature much higher and getting good, even heat everywhere.
* If you add flavoured smoking wood, it helps concentrate the smoke and build the flavour.
* It reduces the tendency to continually faff around. As you build confidence, and by placing food correctly, you stop worrying that everything will be instantly burnt.

The exception to using the lid like this is when I want to cook something (like scallops, or burgers in a barbeque pan) really quickly and then move on. Even then, when the quick stuff is done, I'll usually put the lid back on for the other courses. If I'm using a grilling pan, this might also be put under the lid (with the handle sticking out), especially if the pan is mainly being used to stop food falling through the grate.

## Serving

I put cooked food onto a warm plate and then take this to the table rather than serve people directly from the grill. This lets me concentrate on the cooking rather than try to be fair to a queue of hungry people, especially when I don't know whether they prefer large bits or small, well-done or rarer, etc. It's a good way to reduce the pressure of dealing with a large crowd, especially when children are involved.
