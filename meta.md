## This website doesn't track you or show you ads

This website does not harvest your data, record your visits, or use trackers (such as cookies) on your devices. It's intended to work even if you have disabled javascript or are running ad blockers. The pages are static, meaning that their content is delivered to you exactly as I typed it up, without any server-side use of your personal data. This improves your security and incidentally should speed up page loading.

This site is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
