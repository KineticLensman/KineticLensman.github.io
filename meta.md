## How this site works
This website was created solely using free-to-use software tools and services: 
* GitHub Pages. GitHub (as of July 2018) is the world's largest web-based hosting service for digital content. It's mainly used by collaborative teams of programmers to store their program code and other digital assets. GitHub offers a facility (Pages) for creating simple websites (blogs, documents, etc) that aren't supported by web-advertising. So, you won't see any ads here! We aren't harvesting your data or tracking your visits! 
* Markdown.  Markdown is a simple way of formatting text (i.e. creating headings, bullet lists, etc) that doesn't require specialised software, just a basic text editor. Markdown is easy to learn (compared with typical web content languages such as HTML and CSS) and doesn't get in the way of the writing process. 
* Jekyll. Jekyll is open-source software that converts Markdown files into the web pages you are reading now. Jekyll is built into GitHub Pages, and once things are configured correctly, updating a website is as simple as uploading new text files to GitHub. Jekyll creates websites in advance rather than tailoring content to different readers, which improves your security and reduces loading times.
