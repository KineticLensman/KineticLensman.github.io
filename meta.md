## This website won't show you ads

This website is hosted using GitHub Pages, which isn't supported by web advertising. GitHub uses open technology so the site will move to a different host if GitHub changes it's add-free policy.

## This website doesn't track you

The pages on this site were created in advance (using Jekyll) and do not harvest your data or track your visits.  Because they are static, the pages should also download faster.
