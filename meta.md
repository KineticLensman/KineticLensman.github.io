## This website doesn't track you or show you ads

This website does not harvest your data, record your visits, or use trackers (such as cookies) on your devices. It's intended to work even if you have disabled javascript or are running ad blockers. The pages are static, meaning that their content is delivered to you exactly as I typed it up, without any per-visit server-side use of your personal data. This improves your security and incidentally speeds up page loading.

## This site was built using free open-source tools

This site is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free-to-use and ad-free hosting service for static websites. The pages themselves are built by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which converts text files containing [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatting into the content you see here. Jekyll is integrated with GitHub Pages, so updating my site is as simple as editing my source text files (I'm using the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor for this) and then uploading them to my GitHub repository. 

All of the tools used here are open-source and if necessary I can port the site from GitHub Pages to other [Git](https://git-scm.com/)-based hosting services. There are some [really great tutorials](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) that explain the process I followed to set things up. Now that I have the site up and running, the tools aren't getting in my way (unlike some - I'm looking at you, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)) and I can completely focus on the creative process.
