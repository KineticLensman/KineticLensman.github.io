## I won't track you or show you ads

This website does not harvest your data, record your visits, or place trackers (such as cookies) on your devices. If you have disabled javascript or are running ad blockers, it should still work just fine. To improve your security, the site is static, meaning that its pages are delivered to you exactly as I typed them up, without any server-side collection, processing or storage of your personal data. The lack of processing also means that the site loads faster. The only reader-specific behaviour is performed by your own browser - fitting the text width to the size of your screen.

## I built this site using non-proprietary tools to maintain its independence

To maintain full editorial control over the content of this site, I built it using open-source, non-proprietary tools that are independent of organisations such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Google. If you are interested in the process I followed (or want to try it yourself!), I've described it [here](http://www.non-kinetic-effects.co.uk/blog/2018/06/18/how-this-site-works).
