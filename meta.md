## This website won't show you ads

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which is currently ad-free. I'll move the site to a different hosting service if GitHub changes its ad policy.

## This website doesn't track you

This website does not harvest your data, track your visits, or place cookies or other tracon your devices. It will work identically even if you have disabled javascript or are running ad blockers.

## Technical details

This site is static, meaning that it's content is prepared in advance rather than being tailored to individual readers, and that it doesn't hold or process data about its users. It was built by Jekyll, which is cleanly integrated with GitHub Pages. Most of the content is formatted using Markdown, a markup language for creating rich text using plain text editors (I used Atom). All of the underlying technologies are open source and free to use. The only cost to me was registering the domain name.
