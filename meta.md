## This website doesn't track you or show you ads

This website does not harvest your data, record your visits, or use trackers (such as cookies) on your devices. It's intended to work even if you have disabled javascript or are running ad blockers. The pages are static, meaning that their content is delivered to you exactly as I typed it up, without any server-side use of your personal data. This improves your security and incidentally speeds up page loading.

## Underlying tools and services

This site is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free-to-use and ad-free hosting service for static websites. The pages themselves are built by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which converts text files containing [Markdown](https://jekyllrb.com/) formatting into the content you see here. Jekyll is integrated with GitHub Pages, so updating the site is as simple as uploading edited files to my GitHub repository.

Markdown is fairly basic in terms of the formatting options available but I find this simplicity means that Markdown doesn't really interrupt my flow of writing. I'm using the (Atom)(https://atom.io/) text editor for content creation and Markdown previewing.
