## This website doesn't track you or show you ads

This website does not harvest your data, record your visits, or place trackers (such as cookies) on your devices. If you have disabled javascript or are running ad blockers, it should still work just fine. To improve your security, the site is static, meaning that its pages are delivered to you exactly as I typed them up, without any server-side collection, processing or storage of your personal data. Also, static pages load faster. Your device may tailor the appearance of the pages to better fit its screen.

## I built this site to give myself a simple creative workflow

This site is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free-to-use and ad-free hosting service for static websites. I write the pages using the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor, inserting simple [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatting instructions to get headings, bullet lists, etc. I then upload the files to my GitHub repository, where they are automatically converted into web pages by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Now that I have the site up and running, the tools aren't getting in my way (unlike some - I'm looking at you, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)) and I can completely focus on the creative process.

If you want to try this yourself, there are some [really great tutorials](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) that explain the process I followed to set things up. 

## I'm using open source tools to maintain this site's independence

The development tools I've listed above are open-source, meaning that they are non-proprietary and independent of any particular organisation (such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Google). The exception is GitHub, which is currently owned by Microsoft. However, because GitHub internally uses the open source [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system, I can host my site elsewhere if GitHub's owner changes it for the worse.
